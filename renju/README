1) The Renju_Game.py file is the Game class and a client,
  which recieves history of all steps made so far and returns the new step.
2) The .meta, .data, .index and checkpoint files and necessary for the client to load the predicting model.
3) The run_game_vs_player.py file also requires files, described above.
  The file is an environment to play in Human vs. Machine mode. Fisrt person should chose its color: "b" for black (first player) and "w" for white (second player). Then the game board is pictured every step and the player only has to write his next step, until the game is finished.
  This version of client doesn't include the Monte-Carlo tree search method, and bases only on the trained model.
